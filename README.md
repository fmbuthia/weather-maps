# weather-view

To run this project locally make sure you have node.js installed

Install grunt cli - npm install -g grunt-cli

Unzip the weatherview folder and cd into it

Run npm install

Run bower install

## Note:
After running - bower install, all bower packages will be downloaded. However I had to make some modifications to weather-icons package for things to work smoothly with dark sky api. Therefore before running the web app, make sure to replace weather-icons folder with the custom weather-icons folder provided. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
